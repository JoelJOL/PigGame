            Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is
            rolled or the player decides to "hold".
          </li>
          <li>
            If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next
            player's turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn
            total and the player's turn continues.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their
            score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
